# WD-M7-002 -- Open PR backlog exceeds threshold

## What this means

The total number of open pull requests exceeds the configured `maxOpenPrs` threshold, indicating a review bottleneck or accumulation of unmerged work.

## Common causes

- Review capacity lower than contribution rate
- Large features split into many simultaneous PRs
- Draft or experimental PRs left open indefinitely
- Merge queue delays

## Resolution patterns

### Pattern: Limit work-in-progress
Apply a WIP limit to open PRs. Close or convert to draft any PR that is not actively being reviewed or developed.

### Pattern: Improve review throughput
Establish review rotation or dedicated review time slots to keep the backlog manageable.

## Examples from this codebase

- TBD
