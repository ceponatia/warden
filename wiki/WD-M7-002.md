# WD-M7-002 -- Uncovered High-Churn File

## Description
A file has both high recent edit churn and low test coverage, increasing regression risk.

## Common causes
- Hotspot modules are changed frequently without matching test updates.
- Incident-driven patches bypass test hardening.
- Ownership is spread across multiple teams with unclear test accountability.

## Resolution patterns
- Add a minimum regression test suite before the next feature change.
- Introduce branch-focused tests for recently touched code paths.
- Break large hotspot files into smaller modules to isolate behavior.

## Example
- `src/dashboard/routes.ts` changed 9 times in 7 days with `34%` line coverage.
