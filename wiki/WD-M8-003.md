# WD-M8-003 -- Undocumented Public API

## Description
A public exported API exists in source but is not referenced by any documentation file.

## Common causes
- New public export added without API docs.
- Entry-point surface expanded during refactor.
- Internal modules became public through index exports unintentionally.

## Resolution patterns
- Document intended usage, parameters, and return behavior.
- Deprecate or hide exports that should remain internal.
- Keep package entry points and docs reviewed together.

## Example
- `packages/warden-connector/src/index.ts` exports `createConnector` with no mention in package README.
