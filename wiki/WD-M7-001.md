# WD-M7-001 -- Low File Coverage

## Description
A file's line coverage is below the configured threshold (`thresholds.lowCoveragePct`, default 50%).

## Common causes
- Tests focus on happy-path flows and skip error branches.
- Utility modules are used broadly but never tested directly.
- Recently added files were shipped before test coverage caught up.

## Resolution patterns
- Add focused unit tests around uncovered conditionals and edge cases.
- Add integration tests when behavior crosses package boundaries.
- Prioritize files that are also high churn in the 7-day window.

## Example
- `src/collectors/collect-runtime.ts` at `42%` line coverage with no branch coverage for parsing fallbacks.
