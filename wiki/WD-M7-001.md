# WD-M7-001 -- Pull request open beyond stale threshold

## What this means

A pull request has had no activity (updates, comments, or commits) for longer than the configured `stalePrDays` threshold.

## Common causes

- PR author is blocked waiting for review or CI to pass
- PR scope grew too large and stalled
- Work deprioritized without closing the PR
- Awaiting a dependency PR to merge first

## Resolution patterns

### Pattern: Review and action every open PR
Triage stale PRs in a regular review meeting. Either assign reviewers, close the PR as out of scope, or convert it to a draft to signal it is not ready.

### Pattern: Set a maximum PR lifetime policy
Establish a team norm that PRs older than N days without activity are closed and reopened when ready.

## Examples from this codebase

- TBD
