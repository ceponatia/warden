# WD-M2-001 -- Stale file still imported

## What this means

A file appears stale by commit age but is still imported by active code.

## Common causes

- Utility module stabilized but still critical
- Hidden coupling keeps old file in active dependency graph

## Resolution patterns

### Pattern: Verify relevance and annotate intent
Confirm the file is intentionally stable and document why it remains imported.

## Examples from this codebase

- TBD
