# WD-M4-001 -- Function approaching complexity limit

## What this means

Cyclomatic complexity warnings indicate branching logic is becoming difficult to maintain.

## Common causes

- Layered conditionals in request handlers
- Feature toggles accumulating in one function

## Resolution patterns

### Pattern: Extract decision helpers
Move branch logic to named helpers and isolate decision tables.

## Examples from this codebase

- TBD
