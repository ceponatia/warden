# WD-M7-004 -- Stale branch accumulation

## What this means

One or more non-protected branches have had no commits for longer than the configured `staleBranchDays` threshold.

## Common causes

- Feature branches abandoned after being merged but not deleted
- Experimental branches created but never completed
- Branches kept as "backup" after a merge
- Long-lived branches that diverged and were superseded

## Resolution patterns

### Pattern: Delete merged branches automatically
Enable the "automatically delete head branches" setting on GitHub so merged PR branches are cleaned up immediately.

### Pattern: Audit and prune stale branches
Periodically review branches older than the threshold. Delete branches whose work has been merged or abandoned.

## Examples from this codebase

- TBD
