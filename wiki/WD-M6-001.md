# WD-M6-001 -- TODO/FIXME density increase

## What this means

Debt markers are accumulating faster than they are resolved.

## Common causes

- Deferring cleanup during rapid feature work
- Missing follow-up issue tracking

## Resolution patterns

### Pattern: Convert markers to tracked tasks
Move critical TODO/FIXME items into issues and clear inline debt markers.

## Examples from this codebase

- TBD
