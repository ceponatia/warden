# WD-M8-002 -- Orphaned Documentation Reference

## Description
Documentation references a file, function, or API token that no longer exists in the current codebase.

## Common causes
- File moves or renames without doc updates.
- API rename during refactor with stale examples.
- Removed modules still linked from markdown.

## Resolution patterns
- Update references to current file paths or symbols.
- Remove obsolete sections that no longer apply.
- Add lightweight doc link validation in CI.

## Example
- `README.md:88` references `src/legacy/collector.ts` after the file was deleted.
