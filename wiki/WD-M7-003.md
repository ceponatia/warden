# WD-M7-003 -- CI failure rate exceeds threshold

## What this means

The percentage of failed GitHub Actions workflow runs in the recent sample exceeds the configured `ciFailureRatePct` threshold.

## Common causes

- Flaky tests causing intermittent failures
- A recent change broke core tests and was not reverted
- Infrastructure or dependency issues in the CI environment
- Missing environment secrets or misconfigured workflows

## Resolution patterns

### Pattern: Identify and quarantine flaky tests
Use test retry data to identify tests that fail non-deterministically. Quarantine them while a fix is prepared.

### Pattern: Revert the offending change
If failures started after a specific commit, revert and reopen as a smaller, better-scoped PR.

### Pattern: Audit CI configuration
Check for expired secrets, misconfigured runners, or outdated action versions that may be causing systemic failures.
