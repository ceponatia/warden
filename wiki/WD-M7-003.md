# WD-M7-003 -- Coverage Regression

## Description
Coverage for a file dropped by at least the configured regression threshold (`thresholds.coverageRegressionPct`, default 10 points) compared to the previous snapshot.

## Common causes
- New branches and error handling were added without tests.
- Existing tests were removed or became flaky and were skipped.
- Refactors changed file boundaries and left tests behind.

## Resolution patterns
- Compare prior and current coverage artifacts for the file.
- Restore or replace removed tests before further changes.
- Add CI checks for per-file regression guardrails.

## Example
- `src/agents/runner.ts` dropped from `68%` to `54%` line coverage (`-14` points).
