# WD-M8-001 -- Stale Documentation

## Description
A documentation file has not been updated for longer than the doc staleness threshold while related code changed since the doc's last commit.

## Common causes
- Feature work updates code but skips docs in the same PR.
- Shared docs describe moving targets with no clear owner.
- Refactors changed structure and examples without updating docs.

## Resolution patterns
- Update the stale document with current behavior and links.
- Add docs-update checklist items to PR templates.
- Tie doc ownership to module ownership for hotspots.

## Example
- `docs/thresholds.md` unchanged for 45 days while related config files changed in 6 commits.
