# WD-M4-002 -- Function approaching line-count limit

## What this means

Functions are long enough to hinder reviewability and safe modification.

## Common causes

- End-to-end orchestration and data shaping in one function
- Unfactored validation + execution blocks

## Resolution patterns

### Pattern: Split lifecycle stages
Extract parsing, validation, execution, and formatting into separate functions.

## Examples from this codebase

- TBD
